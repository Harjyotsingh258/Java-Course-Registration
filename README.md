# Java-Course-Registration
This is a small peice of javaFx software which can be used by an college/ institute to help their students pick their courses.

The whole sofware is a combination of three languages. 
We made the GUI from JAVA-FX the database is managed by SQL.
The database is a file. It can be upgraded to a cloud base database. 

For the scope of this project we used a software named SQLLite for adding and changing the data in the Database.

Using the application :
  To use the application, I have provided the source files for the software which will give you all the java files neaded. You can simply import the project or can copy and paste all the files in the source folder.
  
  To success fully run the programme you would need to import the .jar files to yout project. The JAR files are needed to run the SQLite driver in java.
